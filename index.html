          <h2 id="here">About Me</h2>
          <p id="about-me">I'm an 18 year old student from Moldova, living in France. 
Currently focusing on cyber security and software development, I'm constantly experimenting with web dev (with HTML, CSS and JS), Python and Java. 

I've never gotten the opportunity to contribute to a project, <b>yet</b>. But if you think my profile interests you and is suited for any development project, feel free to contact me! I'd be happy to help in any way.
Also if you want to check some of my works, head to my <a href="https://github.com/confusedjpg">Github</a> or <a href="https://codepen.io/confusedjpg">Codepen</a> for some examples.

Hobbies? Well, I like playing the piano and listening to music. I also enjoy reading and playing video games when I've got the time.
But the activity that consumes most of my time is learning. I like learning new stuff, even if the new information taking space in my brain is obscure and not that useful. 
Have you heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogger_Bank_incident">Dogger Bank incident</a>? Or did you know that we absolutely suck (most of the time) at estimating time taken for a task? Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_fallacy">Planning fallacy</a>.

I especially enjoy learning new languages! My native language is Romanian, but I also got used to Russian (due to it being used very often in my home country). Then, I learned English throughout the years by watching cartoons and playing video games which were not available in Romanian. Some years ago I moved to France so I ended up learning French, too (with a bit of experience from my French classes).
And now, I'm focusing on <a href="assets/is-it.png">Finnish</a>. Don't ask me anything about it though, I'm still in a very early stage (uh, Suomalainen kissa on velho ja norjalainen koira on viikinki...Duolingo gives great real life examples).
I took some classes of Spanish and spent some time on Japanese & German, too!
Languages are fun, and taking the time to study the differences and similarities between them is a rewarding process, at least in my opinion. And it allowed me to meet some great people, so that's a plus!

Do you want to read some miscellaneous facts about me? No? <span class="great"><b><i>GREAT.</i></b></span><ul>
<li>I'm 1.93m (6.3ft) and my goal is to get to 2m, but that's a blurry possibility.</li>
<li>I escaped from my kindergarten when I was younger. Luckily they found me not far away, heading towards my house apparently.</li>
<li>I can't say Rrrr the correct way I'm supposed to in Romanian (or Spanish). I can fake it when I'm casually speaking though, which works out just good enough.</li>
<li>I knew how to count to 100 in Italian at around 5 years old, that's impressive, right??? Well if you don't agree then uh, <span class="great">you're not invited to my birthday party.</span> Ahem, sorry.</li>
<li>The mouse I'm currently using is a Logitech M90, and even though I thought I had it since 2007, it seems to have been first manufactured in 2011. Just know it's a very good mouse!
Oh and my monitor is a Samsung SyncMaster 223BW, which IS from 2007, and is equally as reliable. I got a keyboard from that time too but this PC doesn't have a PS/2 port, and the original PC wasn't performant enough. :(</li>
