        <main>Hi, I'm <span>confused.jpg.</span></main>

        <p>Currently living in France, I'm focusing on Maths and Computer Science but I'm interested in very different stuff, such as languages (self estimated levels):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Romanian → <span style="color: rgb(112, 209, 112);">Native</span></li>
                <li>English → <span style="color: rgb(252, 255, 90)">Advanced</span></li>
                <li>French → <span style="color: rgb(252, 255, 90)">Advanced</span></li>
                <li>Russian → <span style="color: orange">Intermediate</span></li>
                <li>Spanish → <span style="color: tomato">Beginner</span></li>
            </ul>
        <p>My hobbies include reading, playing video games (and scripting for them), listening to music and learning. <br />
            <br />
            I've never had the pleasure to get a job or contribute to any projects yet, but I'd gladly consider any opportunity.
            I consider software development as a passion and I always try to improve in any and every aspect of it. 
            I like experimenting with what I do, be it hardware or software related, to try and find more interesting or efficient solutions to the problems I encounter.
            <br />
            So far, I've mostly worked with Python and with a bit of frontend web design (HTML, CSS and JS).
            <br />
            Thanks for checking all this and hope to see you soon!<br />
            <br />
